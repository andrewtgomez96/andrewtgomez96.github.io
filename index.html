                My name is <span class="name">Andrew Gomez</span> and I am currently a fifth year at Cal state Fullerton taking classes to finish
                up my Computer Science major and psychology minor.
                I spend most of my time working at one of my three jobs or finishing up school assignments. When I do
                get free time to myself, I like to DJ at home and practice
                for monthly gigs I get to perform at Play in Costa Mesa. Playing music to a live audience has always
                been
                a passion of mine ever since I was in Drumline in highschool and getting to do that as a side gig is
                definetely
                something I pride myself on. 
            </p>
            <p class="secondParagraph">
                My newest career interest is to be a Full Stack
                Web Developer or Android Mobile Developer because both of these fields are super interesting and
                growing.
