                My name is Andrew Gomez and I am currently a fifth year at Cal state Fullerton taking classes to finish
                up my Computer Science major and psychology minor.
                I spend most of my time working at one of my three jobs or finishing up school assignments. When I do
                get free time to myself, I like to DJ at home and practice
                for monthly gigs I get to perform at Play in Costa Mesa. Playing music to a live audience has always
                been
                a passion of mine ever since I was in Drumline in highschool and getting to do that as a side gig is
                definetely
                something I pride myself on. My newest career interest is to be a Full Stack
                Web Developer or Android Mobile Developer because both of these fields are super interesting and
                growing.

            <h2>My web development experience</h2>
            <p2>
                I am enrolled in this course because I really want to learn as much as I can about web development in
                general and my
                front-end skills could definitely use some work! I do have some mediocre expereince in web-development
                from a few hackathon projects I submitted,
                but definitely feel I lack some of the foundational knowledge to style effectively. I am hoping to
                learn more about front-end frameworks and be more comfortable
                styling my webpages from scratch instead of constantly looking up my solutions on google and following
                css guidlines. I do have expereince using React and
                Bootstrap so getting more comfortable with Bootstrap in this class will be fun! Below I have listed
                some hackathons I have attended in order of when I competed at them.

                Hackathons I have attended in order from my very first one:
                <ol>
                    <li>HackReactor 2017</li>
                    <li>UCI Hacks 2018</li>
                    <li>LA Hacks 2018</li>
                    <li>Novvum Hacks 2018</li>
                </ol>
