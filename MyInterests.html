            <h2>My web development experience</h2>
            <p class="firstParagraph">
                I am enrolled in this course because I really want to learn as much as I can about web development in
                general and my
                front-end skills could definitely use some work! I do have some mediocre expereince in web-development
                from a few hackathon projects I submitted,
                but definitely feel I lack some of the foundational knowledge to style effectively. I am hoping to
                learn more about front-end frameworks and be more comfortable
                styling my webpages from scratch instead of constantly looking up my solutions on google and following
                css guidlines. I do have expereince using React and
                Bootstrap so getting more comfortable with Bootstrap in this class will be fun! Below I have listed
                some hackathons I have attended in order of when I competed at them.
